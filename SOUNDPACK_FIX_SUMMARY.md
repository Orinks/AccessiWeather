# ‚úÖ Soundpack Cleanup Fix Implemented

## Problem Solved
Previously, all soundpacks were being included in the built/packaged versions of AccessiWeather, making the distributions unnecessarily large. The requirement was to only include the **default soundpack** in distributed versions.

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Build Script
- **File**: `installer/make.py`
- **New Function**: `_cleanup_soundpacks()` removes all non-default soundpacks from build directory
- **Integration**: Called automatically during `build`, `package`, and `zip` commands

### 2. Soundpack Cleanup Logic
```python
# Keeps only these items in soundpacks/ directory:
default_soundpacks = {"default", ".gitkeep"}

# Removes all other soundpack directories:
# - classic/
# - custom_1/
# - minimal/
# - nature/
# - scifi/
```

### 3. Verification System
- **File**: `verify_soundpack_cleanup.py`
- **Function**: Verifies ZIP files contain only default soundpack
- **Integration**: New `python installer/make.py verify` command
- **CI/CD**: Added verification step to GitHub Actions workflow

## ‚úÖ Results

### File Size Reduction
**Before cleanup:**
- ZIP: 24,776,259 bytes (24.8MB)
- MSI: 24,883,705 bytes (24.9MB)

**After cleanup:**
- ZIP: 24,434,706 bytes (24.4MB) - **saved 341KB**
- MSI: 24,541,473 bytes (24.5MB) - **saved 342KB**

### Verification Results
```
üîç Checking soundpacks in: AccessiWeather_Portable_v0.9.4.dev0.zip
‚úÖ Only default soundpack found: ['default']
üéâ Soundpack verification passed!
```

## ‚úÖ Available Soundpacks (Development)

### Included in Distribution
- ‚úÖ **default/** - Core sounds (alert.wav, error.wav, startup.wav, etc.)

### Excluded from Distribution (Development Only)
- ‚ùå **classic/** - Classic sounds
- ‚ùå **custom_1/** - Custom soundpack variant
- ‚ùå **minimal/** - Minimal sound set
- ‚ùå **nature/** - Nature-themed sounds
- ‚ùå **scifi/** - Science fiction sounds

## ‚úÖ Build Commands Updated

All commands now automatically clean up soundpacks:

```bash
python installer/make.py build     # Builds app + cleans soundpacks
python installer/make.py package   # Creates MSI + cleans soundpacks
python installer/make.py zip       # Creates ZIP + cleans soundpacks
python installer/make.py verify    # Verifies only default soundpack
```

## ‚úÖ CI/CD Integration

The GitHub Actions workflow automatically:
1. Builds the application
2. Cleans up non-default soundpacks
3. Creates MSI and ZIP distributions
4. Verifies soundpack cleanup
5. Uploads artifacts with only default soundpack

## ‚úÖ Implementation Complete

**Distributed versions of AccessiWeather now contain only the default soundpack, reducing file size and maintaining clean installations.** üéâ

### For Users
- Downloads are smaller and faster
- Clean installation with default sounds
- Professional, focused audio experience

### For Development
- All soundpacks remain available in source code
- Easy testing of different soundpack configurations
- Automated cleanup prevents accidental inclusion
