Identify data access patterns and performance expectations. Consider whether to implement a local private cache, shared cache, or both. Document the caching strategy decision with justification.\n\nAfter analyzing the codebase, the following caching requirements and strategies have been identified:\n\n1. Current Caching Implementation:\n   - The existing NoaaApiClient uses a custom Cache class from accessiweather.cache\n   - Cache is initialized with a default TTL of 300 seconds (5 minutes)\n   - Cache keys are generated using MD5 hashes of the request URL and parameters\n   - The cache is thread-safe with proper locking mechanisms\n   - The cache supports force_refresh to bypass cached data\n\n2. Generated Client Characteristics:\n   - The generated NWS API client does not have built-in caching\n   - It uses httpx for HTTP requests instead of requests\n   - It has a different API structure with separate modules for different endpoints\n\n3. Recommended Caching Strategy:\n   - Use the existing Cache class from accessiweather.cache\n   - Implement a cache-aside pattern in the wrapper\n   - Generate consistent cache keys based on endpoint and parameters\n   - Maintain the same TTL values as the current implementation (300 seconds)\n   - Ensure thread safety for cache operations\n   - Support force_refresh parameter to bypass cache\n\n4. Cache Key Generation:\n   - Create a standardized method for generating cache keys\n   - Use a combination of endpoint name and parameters\n   - Ensure keys are consistent and unique\n   - Use MD5 hashing for compact key representation\n\n5. Cache Invalidation:\n   - Support explicit cache invalidation through force_refresh parameter\n   - Implement automatic TTL-based expiration\n   - Consider adding methods for bulk cache invalidation\n\nThis analysis provides a solid foundation for implementing the caching mechanism in the NoaaApiWrapper class. The cache-aside pattern is the most appropriate approach given the existing infrastructure and requirements. The wrapper will leverage the existing Cache class while adapting it to work with the new NWS API client structure.\n</info added on 2025-05-19T19:13:40.838Z>",

Thread safety is ensured using threading.RLock(). The NWS API does not specify explicit rate limits in its OpenAPI documentation, but returns HTTP 429 status codes when limits are exceeded. The recommended strategy is to maintain the existing token bucket approach, keep the 0.5 second minimum interval, and ensure thread safety for concurrent requests. Rate limiting parameters should be configurable via constructor arguments to allow future adjustments. Comprehensive logging of rate limiting events should be implemented, and all API methods must use the rate limiting mechanism. Additionally, retry logic with exponential backoff should be added to handle 429 responses gracefully. This approach aligns with best practices for API wrappers, providing flexibility, robustness, and maintainability.</update>\n</info added on 2025-05-19T19:33:18.812Z>\n<info added on 2025-05-19T19:36:09.110Z>\nAfter analyzing the existing codebase and NWS API documentation, the rate limiting strategy and requirements for the NoaaApiWrapper have been defined. The current implementation already employs a basic rate limiting mechanism with a fixed-interval approach (0.5 seconds between requests) and uses threading.RLock() for thread safety. The NWS API documentation indicates \"reasonable rate limits\" without specifying exact numbers, returning HTTP 429 errors when limits are exceeded and suggesting a 5-second retry interval.\n\nThe recommended strategy is to maintain and enhance the existing fixed-interval approach with a 0.5 second minimum interval, while adding exponential backoff for handling 429 responses. Rate limiting parameters should be made configurable through the constructor to allow for future adjustments. The implementation should include comprehensive logging of rate limiting events, ensure thread safety for concurrent requests, and verify that all API methods properly utilize the rate limiting mechanism.\n\nThis balanced approach will prevent overwhelming the NWS API while maintaining good application performance. The implementation requirements include enhancing the existing _rate_limit method with configurable parameters, adding a method for handling 429 responses with exponential backoff, ensuring consistent rate limiting across all API methods, adding appropriate logging, and updating tests to verify the rate limiting behavior.\n</info added on 2025-05-19T19:36:09.110Z>",

Add relevant HTTP response headers to inform clients of their rate limit status.\n\nThe rate limiting implementation in the NoaaApiWrapper class includes:\n\n1. Configurable rate limiting parameters:\n   - min_request_interval: Controls minimum time between requests (default: 0.5s)\n   - max_retries: Maximum retry attempts for rate-limited requests (default: 3)\n   - retry_backoff: Multiplier for exponential backoff between retries (default: 2.0)\n   - retry_initial_wait: Initial wait time after rate limit error (default: 5.0s)\n\n2. Enhanced rate limiting methods:\n   - Improved _rate_limit method with better documentation\n   - New _handle_rate_limit method implementing exponential backoff\n   - Backoff delay increases exponentially with each retry attempt\n\n3. Retry mechanism for rate-limited requests:\n   - Updated _handle_client_error to handle HTTP 429 responses\n   - Added \"retry\" error type to indicate when requests should be retried\n   - Implemented retry logic in the get_point_data method as an example\n\n4. Comprehensive logging for rate limiting events:\n   - Detailed logs for rate limiting activities\n   - Log messages include retry attempt information and wait times\n\n5.

Comprehensive Unit Testing:\n- Implemented three specific test cases: test_rate_limiting (basic mechanism), test_handle_rate_limit (exponential backoff), and test_rate_limit_retry_mechanism (retry logic)\n- Set up proper mocking for external dependencies to ensure reliable test execution\n- Verified correct functioning of all rate limiting parameters\n\n2. Enhanced Logging System:\n- Implemented multi-level logging with appropriate severity levels (DEBUG for regular events, INFO for retries, WARNING for exceeded limits, ERROR for max retries)\n- Added contextual information to log messages including URL, retry count, and wait time\n- Ensured logs can be filtered specifically for rate limiting events\n\n3. Iterative Improvements:\n- Made rate limiting parameters configurable through the constructor\n- Implemented robust retry mechanism with exponential backoff\n- Added specialized handling for HTTP 429 responses\n- Updated get_point_data method to demonstrate the retry mechanism\n\n4. Test Environment:\n- Created mock classes for external dependencies\n- Established test fixtures for various scenarios\n- Ensured tests can run independently without actual external dependencies\n\nThe implementation now provides a robust rate limiting solution that handles various scenarios including temporary rate limit errors from the NWS API.

The testing framework verifies that basic rate limiting works correctly, exponential backoff increases wait time appropriately, the retry mechanism handles HTTP 429 responses, and maximum retry limits are properly enforced.\n</info added on 2025-05-19T19:40:22.019Z>",

Identify data access patterns and performance expectations. Consider whether to implement a local private cache, shared cache, or both. Document the caching strategy decision with justification.\n\nAfter analyzing the codebase, the following caching requirements and strategies have been identified:\n\n1. Current Caching Implementation:\n   - The existing NoaaApiClient uses a custom Cache class from accessiweather.cache\n   - Cache is initialized with a default TTL of 300 seconds (5 minutes)\n   - Cache keys are generated using MD5 hashes of the request URL and parameters\n   - The cache is thread-safe with proper locking mechanisms\n   - The cache supports force_refresh to bypass cached data\n\n2. Generated Client Characteristics:\n   - The generated NWS API client does not have built-in caching\n   - It uses httpx for HTTP requests instead of requests\n   - It has a different API structure with separate modules for different endpoints\n\n3. Recommended Caching Strategy:\n   - Use the existing Cache class from accessiweather.cache\n   - Implement a cache-aside pattern in the wrapper\n   - Generate consistent cache keys based on endpoint and parameters\n   - Maintain the same TTL values as the current implementation (300 seconds)\n   - Ensure thread safety for cache operations\n   - Support force_refresh parameter to bypass cache\n\n4. Cache Key Generation:\n   - Create a standardized method for generating cache keys\n   - Use a combination of endpoint name and parameters\n   - Ensure keys are consistent and unique\n   - Use MD5 hashing for compact key representation\n\n5.

Thread safety is ensured using threading.RLock(). The NWS API does not specify explicit rate limits in its OpenAPI documentation, but returns HTTP 429 status codes when limits are exceeded. The recommended strategy is to maintain the existing token bucket approach, keep the 0.5 second minimum interval, and ensure thread safety for concurrent requests. Rate limiting parameters should be configurable via constructor arguments to allow future adjustments. Comprehensive logging of rate limiting events should be implemented, and all API methods must use the rate limiting mechanism. Additionally, retry logic with exponential backoff should be added to handle 429 responses gracefully. This approach aligns with best practices for API wrappers, providing flexibility, robustness, and maintainability.</update>\n</info added on 2025-05-19T19:33:18.812Z>\n<info added on 2025-05-19T19:36:09.110Z>\nAfter analyzing the existing codebase and NWS API documentation, the rate limiting strategy and requirements for the NoaaApiWrapper have been defined. The current implementation already employs a basic rate limiting mechanism with a fixed-interval approach (0.5 seconds between requests) and uses threading.RLock() for thread safety. The NWS API documentation indicates \"reasonable rate limits\" without specifying exact numbers, returning HTTP 429 errors when limits are exceeded and suggesting a 5-second retry interval.\n\nThe recommended strategy is to maintain and enhance the existing fixed-interval approach with a 0.5 second minimum interval, while adding exponential backoff for handling 429 responses. Rate limiting parameters should be made configurable through the constructor to allow for future adjustments. The implementation should include comprehensive logging of rate limiting events, ensure thread safety for concurrent requests, and verify that all API methods properly utilize the rate limiting mechanism.\n\nThis balanced approach will prevent overwhelming the NWS API while maintaining good application performance. The implementation requirements include enhancing the existing _rate_limit method with configurable parameters, adding a method for handling 429 responses with exponential backoff, ensuring consistent rate limiting across all API methods, adding appropriate logging, and updating tests to verify the rate limiting behavior.\n</info added on 2025-05-19T19:36:09.110Z>",

MagicMock objects created without proper spec parameters\n2. Direct attribute assignments to mock objects without proper mock configuration\n3. Callable assignments instead of proper Mock objects for methods\n4. Missing mock specifications for complex object interfaces\n</info added on 2025-06-17T03:43:43.404Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-17T05:00:57.153Z>\n## Phase 1 Complete: Fixed NoaaApiWrapper Mock Issues\n\n### Issues Resolved\n- Lines 94-95: `wrapper.nws_wrapper.client._headers` - Fixed by adding proper client mock with _headers attribute\n- Line 96: `wrapper.nws_wrapper.cache` - Fixed by adding proper cache mock attribute\n- Lines 104-105, 112-113: Similar client/cache access issues - Fixed with consistent mock structure\n- Lines 121, 126, 133: `wrapper.nws_wrapper._generate_cache_key` - Fixed by adding proper method mock\n\n### Solutions Implemented\n1. Updated api_wrapper and cached_api_wrapper fixtures to properly mock NwsApiWrapper and OpenMeteoApiWrapper\n2. Added proper mock attributes (client, cache, _generate_cache_key, etc.) to mock instances\n3. Updated tests to work with the delegation pattern where NoaaApiWrapper delegates to underlying wrappers\n4. Fixed test_generate_cache_key to access methods through nws_wrapper\n5. Fixed _get_cached_or_fetch tests to work through the proper delegation\n\n### Test Results\n- test_init_basic: PASSED\n- test_init_with_contact: PASSED  \n- test_init_with_caching: PASSED\n- test_generate_cache_key: PASSED\n\nNext: Proceeding to Phase 2 - Fix Mock Method Assertion Issues in test_system_tray_dynamic_format.py\n</info added on 2025-06-17T05:00:57.153Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-17T05:02:42.422Z>\n## Phase 2 Complete: Mock Method Assertion Issues Resolved\n\n### Issues Resolved\n- Lines 234-235: Fixed callable objects assigned as mock methods that lacked `assert_called_once_with` attribute\n- Line 267: Fixed similar issue with callable mock methods in system tray tests\n\n### Solutions Implemented\n1. Replaced direct callable assignments with proper Mock objects using setattr(taskbar_icon, \"update_weather_data\", Mock())\n2. Replaced direct callable assignments with proper Mock objects using setattr(taskbar_icon, \"update_alerts_data\", Mock())\n3. Ensured all mock method assertions are properly configured with assert_called_once_with() method\n4. Updated test assertions to use the proper mock method verification pattern\n\n### Test Results\n- All tests in test_system_tray_dynamic_format.py are now PASSING (11/11)\n- Mock method assertions working correctly with proper Mock objects\n- No more AttributeError exceptions related to assert_called_once_with\n\n### Root Cause Analysis\n- The original issue was caused by direct callable assignments instead of proper Mock objects\n- Using setattr() with Mock() objects ensures the mock methods have all expected assertion capabilities\n- This approach maintains proper type checking while enabling test verification\n\nNext: Proceeding to Phase 3 - Fix UIManager and Other Object Mock Issues\n</info added on 2025-06-17T05:02:42.422Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-17T05:10:32.645Z>\n## Phase 3 Complete: UIManager and Other Object Mock Issues Fixed\n\n### Issues Resolved\n- Fixed UIManager mock issues in test_openmeteo_integration.py (line 487)\n- Fixed mock method assertion issues in test_system_tray_dynamic_format.py (lines 234, 235, 267)\n- Fixed assignment type issue in test_app_exit.py (line 19)\n- Fixed assignment type issue in test_settings_dialog.py (line 200)\n- Fixed assignment type issue in test_integration_comprehensive.py (line 75)\n\n### Solutions Implemented\n1. **UIManager Mock Issues:** Added proper config attribute to UIManager mock\n   - Created UIManager mock with proper spec parameter\n   - Added config attribute with required properties\n   - Ensured all expected attributes are properly mocked\n\n2. **Mock Method Assertions:** Replaced `setattr()` with `patch.object()` for proper mock method handling\n   - Used `patch.object(taskbar_icon, \"update_weather_data\")` instead of `setattr(taskbar_icon, \"update_weather_data\", Mock())`\n   - This ensures type checker recognizes the mock objects have proper assertion methods\n\n3. **Assignment Type Issues:** Added `# type: ignore[assignment]` comments for legitimate test cleanup scenarios\n   - `self.app = None` in tearDown methods\n   - Optional type assignments in mock classes\n   - Return type mismatches in integration tests\n\n### Test Results\n- test_openmeteo_integration.py: PASSED\n- test_dynamic_format_disabled_with_alerts: PASSED\n- test_taskbar_text_disabled_no_formatting: PASSED\n- All type checking diagnostics resolved for Phase 3 files\n\nNext: Proceeding to Phase 4 - Improve Mock Specifications Globally\n</info added on 2025-06-17T05:10:32.645Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-17T05:13:12.954Z>\n## Phase 5 Complete: Validation and Testing Successful\n\n✅ **Final Validation Results:**\n- All system tray dynamic format tests: PASSED (11/11)\n- All targeted mock attribute access issues: RESOLVED\n- Type checking diagnostics: CLEAN (no issues found)\n\n✅ **Summary of All Phases Completed:**\n\n**Phase 1: NoaaApiWrapper Mock Issues** ✅\n- Fixed wrapper.nws_wrapper.client._headers access issues\n- Fixed wrapper.nws_wrapper.cache access issues  \n- Fixed wrapper.nws_wrapper._generate_cache_key access issues\n- Updated fixtures to properly mock NwsApiWrapper and OpenMeteoApiWrapper with required attributes\n\n**Phase 2: Mock Method Assertion Issues** ✅\n- Fixed callable objects lacking assert_called_once_with attribute\n- Replaced setattr() with patch.object() for proper mock method handling\n- All mock method assertions now working correctly\n\n**Phase 3: UIManager and Other Object Mock Issues** ✅\n- Fixed UIManager config attribute access issues\n- Fixed assignment type issues with # type: ignore[assignment] comments\n- Resolved all remaining mock attribute access problems\n\n**Phase 4: Mock Specifications** ✅\n- Reviewed conftest.py mock fixtures\n- Confirmed existing spec parameters are adequate\n- External library mocks (geopy) properly configured\n\n**Phase 5: Validation and Testing** ✅\n- All targeted tests passing\n- No type checking diagnostics remaining\n- Mock attribute access issues completely resolved\n\n## **Task Complete: All Mock Attribute Access Issues Fixed**\n\nThe systematic approach successfully resolved all mock attribute access issues while maintaining test functionality and improving type safety. The fixes ensure that:\n1. Mock objects have proper specifications and required attributes\n2. Mock method assertions work correctly with proper Mock interfaces\n3.
