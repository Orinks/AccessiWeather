# Product Requirements Document: AccessiWeather Migration

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for migrating the AccessiWeather application from its current `wxPython`-based implementation to a modern, cross-platform solution using the BeeWare suite, specifically the Toga UI toolkit and the Briefcase deployment tool.

## 2. Project Goals

The primary goals of this migration are to:

*   **Improve Cross-Platform Compatibility**: The new application must run on Windows, macOS, and Linux from a single codebase.
*   **Modernize the Architecture**: The application will be re-architected to use modern Python features, such as `asyncio` for asynchronous operations, and to follow best practices for BeeWare development.
*   **Enhance Maintainability**: The new codebase will be cleaner, more modular, and easier to maintain than the existing `wxPython` version.
*   **Improve Accessibility**: The application will be designed with accessibility in mind, ensuring that it is fully usable with screen readers and other assistive technologies.
*   **Simplify Deployment**: The application will be deployable using Briefcase, which will simplify the process of creating installers for each platform.

## 3. Functional Requirements

The migrated application must have the following functional requirements:

*   **Location Management**: Users must be able to add, remove, and select locations.
*   **Weather Display**: The application must display the current weather conditions, a multi-day forecast, and any active weather alerts.
*   **Settings**: Users must be able to configure the application's settings, such as the update interval and temperature units.
*   **Asynchronous Updates**: The application must automatically refresh the weather data in the background without blocking the UI.
*   **Accessible UI**: The UI must be fully accessible to users with disabilities, including those who use screen readers.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

The migrated application must meet the following non-functional requirements:

*   **Performance**: The application must be responsive and performant, even when fetching and displaying large amounts of weather data.
*   **Stability**: The application must be stable and reliable, with no crashes or memory leaks.
*   **Code Quality**: The codebase must be of high quality, with clear and concise code, comprehensive tests, and thorough documentation.
*   **Security**: The application must be secure, with no vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.

## 5. Migration Plan

The migration will be performed in the following phases:

1.  **Task Generation**: A detailed set of tasks will be generated using Taskmaster based on this PRD.
2.  **Feature Migration**: Each feature from the `wxPython` version will be migrated to the Toga version, following a test-driven development (TDD) approach.
3.  **UI/UX Refinement**: The user interface will be refined to provide a modern and intuitive user experience.
4.  **Testing and Quality Assurance**: The application will be thoroughly tested to ensure that it meets all functional and non-functional requirements.
5.  **Deployment**: The application will be packaged and deployed using Briefcase.
6.  **Legacy Code Removal**: Once the migration is complete and verified, the legacy `wxPython` code will be removed from the project.
