Dynamic format switching is AccessiWeather's intelligent feature that automatically adapts the taskbar display based on current weather conditions. This ensures you always see the most relevant information at a glance.

### How Dynamic Switching Works

The system analyzes current weather data and selects the most appropriate format template:

1. **Weather Condition Analysis**: Evaluates temperature, wind speed, precipitation, visibility, and alerts
2. **Priority Assessment**: Determines which weather factors are most important to display
3. **Format Selection**: Chooses the best template for the current conditions
4. **Automatic Updates**: Switches formats as weather conditions change throughout the day
