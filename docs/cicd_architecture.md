# CI/CD Pipeline Architecture for AccessiWeather

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive CI/CD pipeline architecture for AccessiWeather, a desktop Python application. The pipeline is designed to leverage GitHub Actions for automated testing, code quality checks, security scanning, and deployment automation without requiring external web servers or webhook endpoints.

## Architecture Principles

- **GitHub-Native**: Utilizes GitHub Actions runners and infrastructure
- **Desktop-Focused**: Tailored for desktop application deployment patterns
- **GUI-Aware**: Handles wxPython GUI testing in headless CI environments
- **Quality-First**: Emphasizes code quality, testing, and security
- **Artifact-Centric**: Focuses on building and managing Windows installers
- **Branch-Based**: Supports dev/main branch workflow with feature branches

## Pipeline Stages

### 1. Trigger Events

The pipeline responds to the following GitHub events:
- **Push to main**: Production deployment pipeline
- **Push to dev**: Development/staging pipeline
- **Pull Request**: Code quality and testing pipeline
- **Manual dispatch**: On-demand builds and releases

### 2. Code Quality & Testing Stage

**Triggers**: All push events and pull requests

**Components**:
- Pre-commit hook validation
- Unit test execution with pytest
- Integration test execution
- Code coverage reporting
- Static analysis with mypy
- Code formatting with black
- Import sorting with isort
- Linting with flake8

**Artifacts**: Test reports, coverage reports

### 3. Security & Compliance Stage

**Triggers**: All push events and pull requests

**Components**:
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Security linting with bandit
- License compliance checking
- SAST (Static Application Security Testing)

**Artifacts**: Security scan reports

### 4. Build Stage

**Triggers**: Push to dev/main, manual dispatch

**Components**:
- Python environment setup
- Dependency installation
- PyInstaller executable build
- Windows installer creation with Inno Setup
- Portable ZIP archive creation
- Version extraction from pyproject.toml

**Artifacts**:
- Windows executable
- Windows installer (.exe)
- Portable ZIP archive
- Build logs

### 5. Deployment Stage

**Development Environment**:
- **Trigger**: Push to dev branch
- **Actions**: Deploy to staging artifacts repository
- **Notifications**: Development team notifications

**Production Environment**:
- **Trigger**: Push to main branch (with manual approval)
- **Actions**: Create GitHub release with artifacts
- **Notifications**: Release notifications

## GitHub Actions Workflow Structure

### Primary Workflows

1. **ci.yml**: Continuous Integration
   - Runs on: push, pull_request
   - Jobs: test, lint, security-scan
   - Matrix: Python 3.11, 3.12 on windows-latest

2. **build.yml**: Build and Package
   - Runs on: push to dev/main, workflow_dispatch
   - Jobs: build-windows, create-installer
   - Artifacts: Executables, installers, portable archives

3. **release.yml**: Release Management
   - Runs on: push to main (with approval)
   - Jobs: create-release, upload-assets
   - Creates GitHub releases with artifacts

### Workflow Dependencies

```
ci.yml (Quality Gate)
    ↓
build.yml (Build Artifacts)
    ↓
release.yml (Deploy/Release)
```

## Environment Configuration

### Development Environment
- **Branch**: dev
- **Deployment**: Artifact storage for testing
- **Notifications**: Slack/email to dev team
- **Approval**: Automatic

### Production Environment
- **Branch**: main
- **Deployment**: GitHub releases
- **Notifications**: Public release notifications
- **Approval**: Manual approval required

## Integration Points

### Pre-commit Hooks Integration
- Validate pre-commit hooks run in CI
- Ensure consistency between local and CI environments
- Block commits that don't pass pre-commit checks

### Version Management
- Extract version from pyproject.toml
- Sync version across setup.py and version.py
- Tag releases with semantic versioning

### wxPython GUI Testing
- **Headless Environment**: Sets `DISPLAY=""` to prevent GUI creation
- **Mock-Heavy Testing**: GUI tests use extensive mocking to avoid real UI
- **Windows Runners**: Uses native Windows environment for wxPython compatibility
- **Import Testing**: Validates application imports without GUI initialization

### Artifact Management
- Store build artifacts in GitHub Actions
- Retention policy: 90 days for dev, permanent for releases
- Artifact naming: `AccessiWeather_v{version}_{type}.{ext}`

## Security Considerations

- **Secrets Management**: GitHub Secrets for API keys
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection
- **Code Signing**: Windows code signing for installers
- **Access Control**: Branch protection rules and required reviews

## Monitoring & Notifications

### Success Notifications
- Successful builds to development team
- Release notifications to stakeholders
- Deployment confirmations

### Failure Notifications
- Build failures with logs
- Security scan alerts
- Deployment rollback notifications

## Rollback Strategy

### Automated Rollback Triggers
- Failed health checks post-deployment
- Critical security vulnerabilities
- User-reported critical issues

### Manual Rollback Process
- Revert to previous GitHub release
- Rollback database migrations (if applicable)
- Notify users of rollback

## Performance Optimization

- **Caching**: pip dependencies, build artifacts
- **Parallel Jobs**: Run tests and security scans concurrently
- **Incremental Builds**: Only rebuild when source changes
- **Matrix Strategy**: Test across multiple Python versions efficiently

## Documentation Requirements

- Pipeline architecture documentation (this document)
- Workflow troubleshooting guide
- Developer onboarding for CI/CD
- Release process documentation

## Success Metrics

- **Build Success Rate**: >95%
- **Build Time**: <15 minutes for full pipeline
- **Test Coverage**: Reported for informational purposes
- **Security Scan Pass Rate**: 100%
- **Deployment Success Rate**: >98%

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with external monitoring tools
- Automated performance testing
- Multi-platform builds (macOS, Linux)
- Advanced deployment strategies (blue-green, canary)
- Integration with project management tools
