A desktop weather application with robust accessibility features and international weather support. Built using the BeeWare/Toga framework with a focus on screen reader compatibility and keyboard navigation.

## Quickstart (Developers)

- Prereqs: Python 3.10+ (3.12 recommended), Git
- Create a virtual environment and install dev deps:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
# Windows (bash)
source .venv/Scripts/activate
# macOS/Linux
# source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

- Run the app with Briefcase during development:

```bash
briefcase dev
```

- Run tests and linters:

```bash
pytest -q
ruff check --fix . && ruff format
```

## Packaging & Distribution (Briefcase)

This project uses BeeWare Briefcase for packaging. Common commands:

```bash
# Create platform-specific project skeletons
briefcase create

# Build app artifacts
briefcase build

# Generate distributables (MSI/DMG/PKG/ZIP where supported)
briefcase package
```

Updates are delivered via GitHub Releases and integrated with the app’s Settings → Updates tab.

### Using installer/make.py

A convenience wrapper around Briefcase is provided at installer/make.py:

```bash
# Show environment and detected versions
python installer/make.py status

# First-time platform scaffold (windows|macOS|linux)
python installer/make.py create --platform windows

# Build and then package an installer (MSI/DMG/PKG depending on platform)
python installer/make.py build --platform windows
python installer/make.py package --platform windows

# Run the app in development mode (same as `briefcase dev`)
python installer/make.py dev

# Run tests in a Briefcase dev app (falls back to pytest if needed)
python installer/make.py test

# Create a portable ZIP from the build output (Windows-focused helper)
python installer/make.py zip --platform windows

# Clean Briefcase artifacts
python installer/make.py clean --platform windows
```


## Configuration & Portable Mode

- Default config/data lives in a user app data directory (platform-dependent)
- Portable mode stores configuration alongside the app; you can force it with:

```bash
accessiweather --portable
```

## Project Structure (high level)

- src/accessiweather: main application package (Toga app, dialogs, services, clients)
- tests: unit/integration tests (Toga dummy used where needed)
- pyproject.toml: project metadata, Briefcase and Ruff configuration
- pytest.ini: test configuration

## Accessibility

- Screen reader friendly text and focus management
- Keyboard-first navigation across all dialogs and main views
- Temperature display format: 84°F (29°C)

## Notes

- This README section reflects the current Toga + Briefcase workflow.
- The legacy “Building Binaries” section below describes a historical PyInstaller/Inno Setup process; use Briefcase for packaging going forward.
