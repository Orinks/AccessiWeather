## Installation

### Option 1: Download Pre-built Binaries (Recommended)
Visit our [GitHub Pages download site](https://orinks.github.io/AccessiWeather/) to download:
- **Windows Installer**: Full installation with Start Menu integration
- **Portable Version**: Run from any folder without installation

### Option 2: Install from Source
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Orinks/AccessiWeather.git
cd AccessiWeather

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .
```

### Option 3: Run with Portable Mode
```bash
# Force portable mode (saves config in app directory)
accessiweather --portable
```

## First-time Setup

1. **Run the application** to create the configuration directory:
   ```bash
   accessiweather
   ```

2. **Configure weather data source** (optional):
   - Go to Settings â†’ General tab
   - Choose your preferred weather data source:
     - **National Weather Service**: US locations only (includes alerts)
     - **Open-Meteo**: International locations (no alerts)
     - **Automatic**: Best of both (recommended)

3. **NOAA API setup** (required for NWS data):
   - The application will prompt for your contact information
   - This is required by NOAA's terms of service for API access
   - Your information is stored locally and only sent to NOAA

4. **Customize settings** (optional):
   - Update interval (1-1440 minutes)
   - Temperature units (Fahrenheit, Celsius, or both)
   - Alert radius and precision
   - System tray behavior
   - Taskbar icon customization

## Building Binaries

AccessiWeather includes a PowerShell script to build Windows binaries and installers.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+ (Python 3.11 recommended)
- PowerShell 5.0+
- [Inno Setup 6](https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php) (for creating installers)

### Building Steps

1. Ensure Inno Setup is installed and in your PATH
   ```powershell
   # You can install Inno Setup using winget
   winget install JRSoftware.InnoSetup
   ```

2. Run the build script from the project root directory
   ```powershell
   # Navigate to the project directory
   cd path\to\AccessiWeather

   # Run the build script
   .\installer\build_installer.ps1
   ```

3. The script will:
   - Check for processes that might interfere with the build
   - Install PyInstaller if needed
   - Build the executable using PyInstaller
   - Create a portable ZIP archive
   - Build an installer with Inno Setup

4. After completion, you'll find the following in the `dist` directory:
   - `AccessiWeather_Setup_v{version}.exe` - Windows installer
   - `AccessiWeather_Portable_v{version}.zip` - Portable ZIP archive
   - `AccessiWeather` folder - Standalone executable and dependencies

   The version number is automatically extracted from `setup.py`.

### Troubleshooting

- If the script can't find Inno Setup, ensure it's installed and the `iscc` command is in your PATH
- If you encounter file locking issues, the script will help identify and close interfering processes
- For detailed logs, check the console output during the build process

## Requirements

- **Python 3.7+** (Python 3.11+ recommended for best performance)
- **Toga 0.5.1+** (BeeWare GUI framework, automatically installed with pip)
- **Internet connection** for weather data access
- **Windows 10+** (primary platform), Linux and macOS support available

## Weather Data Sources

### National Weather Service (NWS)
- **Coverage**: United States only
- **Features**: Weather alerts, watches, warnings, detailed forecasts
- **API**: Free, no registration required
- **Contact info**: Required by NOAA terms of service

### Open-Meteo
- **Coverage**: Worldwide
- **Features**: Current conditions, forecasts (no alerts)
- **API**: Free, no registration required
- **Limitations**: No severe weather alerts available

### Automatic Mode (Recommended)
- **US locations**: Uses NWS (includes alerts)
- **International locations**: Uses Open-Meteo
- **Best of both**: Maximum coverage with alerts where available

## Known Issues

- **Screen reader parsing**: Nationwide discussions may be read incorrectly by some screen readers despite correct data formatting
- **Escape key**: Minimize to tray shortcut may not work consistently in all scenarios
- **Linux support**: Experimental - some features may not work as expected
- **API limitations**: Open-Meteo does not provide severe weather alerts
- **Geocoding**: May occasionally find locations outside supported coverage areas

## Usage Tips

### Keyboard Navigation
- **Tab/Shift+Tab**: Navigate between controls
- **Enter/Space**: Activate buttons and checkboxes
- **Arrow keys**: Navigate lists and dropdowns
- **Escape**: Minimize to system tray (when enabled)
- **F5**: Refresh weather data
- **Ctrl+S**: Open settings dialog

### System Tray
- **Right-click tray icon**: Access context menu
- **Double-click tray icon**: Show/hide main window
- **Minimize behavior**: Configurable in settings

### Weather Alerts
- **Desktop notifications**: Automatic for new alerts
- **Alert details**: Click any alert for full information
- **Precise targeting**: County/township level accuracy
- **Customizable radius**: Adjust coverage area in settings
