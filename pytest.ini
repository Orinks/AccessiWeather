# PARALLEL EXECUTION (pytest-xdist) - ENABLED BY DEFAULT
# =============================================================================
# Parallel execution is now enabled by default (-n auto --dist loadscope).

# Options:
#   pytest                  # Runs in parallel (default)
#   pytest -n 0             # Disable parallel, run serial
#   pytest -n 4             # Use exactly 4 workers
#
# For coverage with parallel execution:
#   pytest --cov=accessiweather --cov-report=term-missing
#
# To exclude tests marked as no_parallel:
#   pytest -m "not no_parallel"

# Test markers for categorization
markers =
    unit: Unit tests - fast, isolated tests
    integration: Integration tests - test component interactions
    ci: CI-related tests
    property: Property-based tests using Hypothesis
    asyncio: marks tests as async
    slow: marks tests as slow
    accessibility: marks tests related to accessibility features
    toga: marks tests specific to Toga framework
    wx_only: marks tests that only run with wxPython (skip in Toga environment)
    e2e: End-to-end tests - full application workflow tests
    gui: GUI tests - tests requiring wxPython GUI components
    slow: Slow tests - tests that take more than 5 seconds
    api: API tests - tests that interact with external APIs
    network: Network tests - tests requiring network connectivity
    smoke: Smoke tests - basic functionality verification
    flaky: marks tests that may fail intermittently and should be retried
    no_parallel: marks tests that cannot run in parallel (shared resources, fixed ports, etc.)
    live_only: marks tests that only run with real APIs (LIVE_WEATHER_TESTS=1)
    performance: Performance tests - verify operations complete within time limits
