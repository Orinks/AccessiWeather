A strong cold front will bring rain and thunderstorms to the eastern U.S.
Some storms may be severe with damaging winds and hail.
Behind the front, much cooler temperatures are expected.
Snow is possible in the higher elevations of the Northeast.

The front will push offshore by Friday evening, with high pressure
building in behind it. Dry and cooler conditions will prevail
across much of the eastern half of the country for the weekend.

Meanwhile, a developing low pressure system will bring increasing
precipitation chances to the Pacific Northwest by Saturday.
