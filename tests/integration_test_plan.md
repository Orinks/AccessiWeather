# AccessiWeather Integration Testing Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive integration testing plan for AccessiWeather to ensure all components work together correctly with the new NWS API wrapper and Open-Meteo integration.

## Testing Scope

### Components to Test
1. **API Layer Integration**
   - NoaaApiWrapper with generated NWS client
   - OpenMeteoApiClient integration
   - WeatherService multi-source coordination
   - Cache integration across all APIs

2. **Service Layer Integration**
   - WeatherService with both NWS and Open-Meteo clients
   - LocationService with geocoding and location management
   - NotificationService with weather alerts
   - National discussion scraper integration

3. **GUI Integration**
   - WeatherApp main window with service layer
   - Settings dialog with configuration persistence
   - System tray integration
   - Timer-based refresh mechanisms
   - Alert notifications and dialogs

4. **Data Flow Integration**
   - Configuration loading and persistence
   - Location management and storage
   - Weather data caching and retrieval
   - Error handling and fallback mechanisms

### Key User Flows to Test

#### 1. Application Startup Flow
- **Scenario**: User starts AccessiWeather for the first time
- **Components**: Main app, config system, location manager, weather service
- **Expected**: App loads, shows location dialog, fetches initial weather data
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - App starts without errors
  - Configuration is created with defaults
  - Location dialog appears for first-time users
  - Weather data loads successfully after location selection

#### 2. Weather Data Refresh Flow
- **Scenario**: User manually refreshes weather data or automatic refresh occurs
- **Components**: WeatherService, API clients, cache, UI updates
- **Expected**: Fresh data fetched, UI updated, cache refreshed
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Current conditions update correctly
  - Forecast data refreshes
  - Hourly forecast updates
  - UI reflects new data immediately
  - Cache is updated with new data

#### 3. Location Change Flow
- **Scenario**: User changes location via settings or location dialog
- **Components**: LocationManager, WeatherService, configuration, UI
- **Expected**: New location saved, weather data fetched for new location
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Location is saved to configuration
  - Weather data fetches for new coordinates
  - UI updates with new location name
  - Previous location data is cleared

#### 4. Data Source Selection Flow
- **Scenario**: User changes data source (NWS/Open-Meteo/Auto) in settings
- **Components**: WeatherService, configuration, API clients
- **Expected**: Correct API is used based on selection and location
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Auto mode selects NWS for US, Open-Meteo for international
  - Manual selection overrides auto behavior
  - Data format remains consistent across sources
  - Fallback works when primary source fails

#### 5. Alert Processing Flow
- **Scenario**: Weather alerts are available for user's location
- **Components**: WeatherService, NotificationService, alert dialogs
- **Expected**: Alerts fetched, processed, and displayed to user
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Alerts are fetched from appropriate source
  - Alert notifications appear
  - Alert details can be viewed
  - Alert status is tracked correctly

#### 6. Error Handling Flow
- **Scenario**: Network issues, API failures, or invalid data
- **Components**: All API clients, error handling, fallback mechanisms
- **Expected**: Graceful degradation, fallback to alternative sources
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Network errors don't crash the app
  - API failures trigger fallback mechanisms
  - User is informed of issues appropriately
  - Cached data is used when available

### Interface Testing

#### 1. WeatherService ↔ API Clients
- Test data flow from NWS API wrapper to WeatherService
- Test data flow from Open-Meteo client to WeatherService
- Test automatic source selection logic
- Test fallback mechanisms between sources

#### 2. WeatherService ↔ GUI Components
- Test weather data display in main window
- Test forecast data rendering
- Test alert data presentation
- Test error message display

#### 3. Configuration ↔ All Components
- Test settings persistence across app restarts
- Test configuration migration
- Test default value handling
- Test invalid configuration recovery

#### 4. Cache ↔ API Clients
- Test cache hit/miss scenarios
- Test cache expiration handling
- Test cache invalidation
- Test concurrent access to cache

## Test Environment Requirements

### Development Environment
- Python 3.7+ with all dependencies installed
- Access to test configuration directory
- Mock data for offline testing
- Network access for live API testing (with rate limiting)

### Test Data Requirements
- Sample NWS API responses (current, forecast, alerts)
- Sample Open-Meteo API responses
- Test location coordinates (US and international)
- Invalid/edge case data samples
- Configuration files for different scenarios

### Mock Requirements
- HTTP request mocking for API calls
- File system mocking for configuration tests
- Timer mocking for refresh testing
- GUI event simulation for user interaction tests

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
1. All user flows complete successfully without errors
2. Data consistency maintained across all components
3. Fallback mechanisms work correctly
4. Configuration changes take effect immediately
5. Cache improves performance without data staleness

### Performance Requirements
1. Initial app startup < 5 seconds
2. Weather data refresh < 10 seconds
3. Location change response < 5 seconds
4. UI updates appear within 1 second of data availability

### Reliability Requirements
1. App handles network disconnection gracefully
2. Invalid API responses don't crash the application
3. Configuration corruption is recoverable
4. Memory usage remains stable during extended operation

### Accessibility Requirements
1. All UI updates are announced to screen readers
2. Keyboard navigation works throughout the application
3. High contrast mode is supported
4. Text scaling works correctly

## Test Categories

### Automated Integration Tests
- API integration tests with mocked responses
- Service layer integration tests
- Configuration system tests
- Cache integration tests

### Manual Integration Tests
- Full GUI workflow testing
- Real API testing with rate limiting
- Cross-platform compatibility testing
- Accessibility testing with screen readers

### Performance Integration Tests
- Load testing with multiple concurrent requests
- Memory usage monitoring during extended operation
- Cache performance validation
- UI responsiveness testing

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas
1. **API Rate Limiting**: Real API testing must respect rate limits
2. **Network Dependencies**: Tests requiring network access may be flaky
3. **GUI Testing**: Platform-specific GUI behavior variations
4. **Timing Issues**: Race conditions in async operations

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Use mock data for most tests, real APIs sparingly
2. Implement retry logic for network-dependent tests
3. Use headless testing where possible
4. Add explicit synchronization for async operations
