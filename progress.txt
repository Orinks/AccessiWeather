# Progress Log
Run: d7a8979f-776d-40d5-9f15-fbf698da7289
Task: Integrate Prism (prismatoid) for screen reader output in Weather Assistant
Started: 2026-02-11 14:47 UTC

## Codebase Patterns
- Python 3.12, pyproject.toml based, setuptools build
- Tests use pytest with xdist (parallel), run via `python -m pytest tests/ -x -q`
- Pre-commit hooks: trailing whitespace, end-of-file-fixer, ruff lint+format
- Pre-existing test failure in test_weather_assistant_dialog.py (55°F vs 55.0°F) — not our issue
- tomllib available for parsing pyproject.toml in tests
- Source in src/accessiweather/, tests in tests/
- PR #285 targets dev from feature/weather-chat — reuse existing PRs when branch already has one

## 2026-02-11 14:47 - US-001: Add prismatoid as optional dependency in pyproject.toml
- Added `screenreader` optional-dependencies group with `prismatoid>=0.7.0`
- Files changed: pyproject.toml, tests/test_pyproject_screenreader_dep.py
- **Learnings:** Pre-commit hooks auto-fix files; need to re-add and retry commit

## 2026-02-11 15:12 - US-002: Create pull request against dev branch
- Ran ruff format (fixed 1 file), ruff check (passed), tests (1209 passed, 2 pre-existing failures)
- Pushed all commits to origin/feature/weather-chat
- Updated existing PR #285 (feature/weather-chat → dev) with new title, body referencing #288
- PR URL: https://github.com/Orinks/AccessiWeather/pull/285
- **Learnings:** Check for existing PRs before creating new ones (gh pr create fails if one exists)
