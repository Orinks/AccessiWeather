## 2026-02-11 22:26 - US-005: Create NationwideDiscussionDialog with tabbed layout
- Created NationwideDiscussionDialog(wx.Dialog) with wx.Notebook tabs: WPC, SPC, NHC, CPC
- WPC: Short Range, Medium Range, Extended, QPF text controls
- SPC: Day 1, Day 2, Day 3 Convective Outlook text controls
- NHC: Atlantic, East Pacific Tropical Weather Outlook text controls
- CPC: 6-10 Day, 8-14 Day Outlook text controls
- All controls have name= for screen reader accessibility, TE_READONLY, keyboard navigable
- Close button with &Close accelerator
- set_discussion_text() helper for programmatic text setting
- show_nationwide_discussion_dialog() convenience function exported from dialogs package
- 38 tests using AST parsing (no wx.App needed) covering structure, widgets, accessibility names, exports
- Files: src/accessiweather/ui/dialogs/nationwide_discussion_dialog.py, __init__.py, tests/test_nationwide_discussion_dialog.py
- **Learnings:** Use AST parsing for wx dialog tests to avoid needing display/wx.App; pre-commit hooks auto-fix ruff issues so re-stage after first failed commit

## 2026-02-11 21:50 - US-002: Add NHC tropical outlook scraping to NationalDiscussionService
- Added fetch_nhc_discussions() method scraping Atlantic and East Pacific tropical outlooks from nhc.noaa.gov
- Added _make_html_request() for HTML GET with retry logic (parallel to _make_request for JSON)
- Added _extract_nhc_outlook_text() using BeautifulSoup to parse <pre> tags, div#outlook, and class-based fallbacks
- Added is_hurricane_season() static method returning True for June-November
- All errors return descriptive strings instead of raising exceptions
- Files changed: src/accessiweather/services/national_discussion_service.py, tests/test_nhc_discussions.py
- 25 tests all passing: fetch_nhc_discussions (success, errors, timeout, structure), extract text (pre, div, no content, empty, malformed), is_hurricane_season (all 12 months), _make_html_request (success, connection error, HTTP error, retries)
- **Learnings:** Write tool may not persist files in this env; use exec cat>file for reliability. The national_discussion_service.py file from US-001 was lost and had to be recreated.
