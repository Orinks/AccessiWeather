# Progress Log
Run: d7a8979f-776d-40d5-9f15-fbf698da7289
Task: Integrate Prism (prismatoid) for screen reader output in Weather Assistant
Started: 2026-02-11 14:47 UTC

## Codebase Patterns
- Python 3.12, pyproject.toml based, setuptools build
- Tests use pytest with xdist (parallel), run via `python -m pytest tests/ -x -q`
- Pre-commit hooks: trailing whitespace, end-of-file-fixer, ruff lint+format
- Pre-existing test failure in test_weather_assistant_dialog.py (55°F vs 55.0°F) — not our issue
- tomllib available for parsing pyproject.toml in tests
- Source in src/accessiweather/, tests in tests/
- PR #285 targets dev from feature/weather-chat — reuse existing PRs when branch already has one

## 2026-02-11 14:47 - US-001: Add prismatoid as optional dependency in pyproject.toml
- Added `screenreader` optional-dependencies group with `prismatoid>=0.7.0`
- Files changed: pyproject.toml, tests/test_pyproject_screenreader_dep.py
- **Learnings:** Pre-commit hooks auto-fix files; need to re-add and retry commit
---

## 2026-02-11 15:12 - US-002: Create pull request against dev branch
- Ran ruff format (fixed 1 file), ruff check (passed), tests (1209 passed, 2 pre-existing failures)
- Pushed all commits to origin/feature/weather-chat
- Updated existing PR #285 (feature/weather-chat → dev) with new title, body referencing #288
- PR URL: https://github.com/Orinks/AccessiWeather/pull/285
- **Learnings:** Check for existing PRs before creating new ones (gh pr create fails if one exists)

## 2026-02-11 16:52 - US-003: Add location resolution for tool calls
- Added `LocationResolver` class in `ai_tools.py` with default location matching (case-insensitive, whitespace-trimmed) and geocoding fallback
- `resolve()` returns `(lat, lon, display_name)` tuple; raises `ValueError` on failure
- Updated `WeatherToolExecutor.__init__` to accept `default_lat/lon/name` and create a `LocationResolver`
- `WeatherToolExecutor.execute()` now catches `ValueError`/`Exception` from handlers and returns error strings instead of crashing
- Updated existing test for geocoding failure (no longer raises, returns error string)
- Created `tests/test_location_resolver.py` with 14 tests: default matching, case-insensitive, whitespace, geocoding fallback, failure handling, no-default config, executor integration
- **Learnings:** WeatherToolExecutor.execute() should return error strings rather than raise for tool call loop compatibility (AI needs to see the error as tool result)

## 2026-02-11 17:00 - US-004: Format tool results for readable AI context
- Made formatters public: format_current_weather(), format_forecast(), format_alerts() in ai_tools.py
- format_current_weather: extracts temperature, feels_like/feelsLike, conditions (description/textDescription), humidity, wind/windSpeed, pressure/barometricPressure
- format_forecast: shows up to 7 periods with name, temperature, short/detailed forecast
- format_alerts: shows event, severity, headline, description (truncated to 300 chars); "No active alerts." when empty
- All formatters handle None/missing fields gracefully via _append_field helper
- WeatherToolExecutor.execute() uses the new public formatters
- Created tests/test_ai_tools_formatters.py with 31 tests covering all formatters
- **Learnings:** WeatherService response fields vary by backend (snake_case vs camelCase); formatters check both variants
---

## 2026-02-11 19:04 - US-005: Update system prompt and add integration test
- Updated SYSTEM_PROMPT in weather_assistant_dialog.py to mention available tools and guide AI to use them for location-specific queries
- Created tests/test_weather_assistant_integration.py with 8 tests covering full tool call flow (single, multiple, chained), direct response, error recovery, and system prompt validation
- Used AST parsing to read SYSTEM_PROMPT without importing wx/prism (avoids Linux CI failures)
- Files changed: src/accessiweather/ui/dialogs/weather_assistant_dialog.py, tests/test_weather_assistant_integration.py
- **Learnings:** Use ast.parse + ast.literal_eval to extract module-level constants from files that have unresolvable imports
---

## 2026-02-12T19:22Z - US-002: Create NOAA Weather Radio stream URL builder
- Created src/accessiweather/noaa_radio/stream_url.py with StreamURLProvider class
- get_stream_url(call_sign) returns primary URL or None
- get_stream_urls(call_sign) returns list of URLs for fallback
- Built-in database of 8 known station stream URLs from Broadcastify
- Fallback URL generation for unknown stations (configurable)
- Custom URL override support via constructor
- Case-insensitive call sign handling with whitespace normalization
- has_known_url() helper method
- Updated __init__.py to export StreamURLProvider
- 14 tests covering all acceptance criteria
- Files: src/accessiweather/noaa_radio/stream_url.py, tests/test_noaa_radio_stream_url.py
- **Learnings:** pre-commit hooks auto-fix ruff issues on first commit attempt; just re-add and commit again
---

## 2026-02-12T19:52Z - US-005: Wire dialog controls to RadioPlayer and StationDatabase
- Dialog wiring was already implemented in US-004 (RadioPlayer, StationDatabase, StreamURLProvider all instantiated and connected)
- Added 12 dedicated integration tests covering full play/stop cycle, error recovery, volume control, station selection, dialog cleanup, station loading, and all error states
- Files: tests/test_noaa_radio_dialog_integration.py
- **Learnings:** US-004 was thorough enough to include the wiring; this story was mainly about verifying integration coverage
