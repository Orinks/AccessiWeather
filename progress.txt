- Created NationwideDiscussionDialog(wx.Dialog) with wx.Notebook tabs: WPC, SPC, NHC, CPC
- WPC: Short Range, Medium Range, Extended, QPF text controls
- SPC: Day 1, Day 2, Day 3 Convective Outlook text controls
- NHC: Atlantic, East Pacific Tropical Weather Outlook text controls
- CPC: 6-10 Day, 8-14 Day Outlook text controls
- All controls have name= for screen reader accessibility, TE_READONLY, keyboard navigable
- Close button with &Close accelerator
- set_discussion_text() helper for programmatic text setting
- show_nationwide_discussion_dialog() convenience function exported from dialogs package
- 38 tests using AST parsing (no wx.App needed) covering structure, widgets, accessibility names, exports
- Files: src/accessiweather/ui/dialogs/nationwide_discussion_dialog.py, __init__.py, tests/test_nationwide_discussion_dialog.py
- **Learnings:** Use AST parsing for wx dialog tests to avoid needing display/wx.App; pre-commit hooks auto-fix ruff issues so re-stage after first failed commit
