		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Toga Project Structure",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Toga project setup into detailed steps including environment setup, project initialization, and code migration from wxPython.",
			"reasoning": "This is a relatively straightforward setup task with clear steps. The complexity is low as it involves standard project initialization procedures, though it requires careful migration of existing code."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Main Window and Layout",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the main window implementation into subtasks covering window creation, layout system implementation, component placeholders, and menu structure.",
			"reasoning": "Creating the main window requires understanding Toga's layout system which differs from wxPython. Moderate complexity due to the need to establish the foundation for all other UI components."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Migrate Weather Data Display",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the weather data display migration into subtasks covering UI components, data binding, formatting, refresh functionality, and accessibility features.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves translating wxPython widgets to Toga equivalents while maintaining functionality. The complexity comes from ensuring proper data binding and maintaining the same user experience in a different framework."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Forecast Display",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the forecast display implementation into subtasks covering table creation, custom renderers, data binding, sorting functionality, and styling.",
			"reasoning": "Higher complexity due to the need to implement custom table functionality in Toga, which may require more work than the equivalent wxPython components. May need custom solutions if Toga's Table widget lacks certain features."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Migrate Alert System",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the alert system migration into subtasks covering dialog implementation, asyncio integration, platform-native notifications, keyboard accessibility, and sound playback.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to the need to implement platform-specific notifications and replace wxPython's Timer with asyncio. Requires careful consideration of accessibility and cross-platform compatibility."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Location Selection",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the location selection functionality into subtasks covering dropdown implementation, search functionality, favorites management, and data flow integration.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity as it involves creating interactive UI elements and managing data persistence. The task requires careful integration with the weather data system."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Migrate Settings Dialog",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the settings dialog migration into subtasks covering dialog creation, widget implementation, settings organization, persistence, and menu integration.",
			"reasoning": "Moderately complex due to the variety of settings options that need to be implemented and the requirement for persistent storage. Requires careful UI design to maintain usability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Keyboard Shortcuts",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the keyboard shortcuts implementation into subtasks covering shortcut identification, implementation in Toga, and help overlay creation.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity due to the need to ensure cross-platform compatibility of shortcuts and proper integration with Toga's Command system. Requires thorough testing across platforms."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Migrate Background Operations",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the background operations migration into subtasks covering operation identification, asyncio implementation, task management, error handling, UI updates, and performance optimization.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to the fundamental shift from wxPython's event-based system to asyncio. Requires careful management of concurrency and thread safety when updating the UI."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Error Handling and Logging",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the error handling system into subtasks covering logging implementation, exception handling, error dialogs, and log viewer creation.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity as it requires a systematic approach to error handling throughout the application. The implementation of a log viewer adds some complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Enhance Accessibility Features",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the accessibility enhancements into subtasks covering element labeling, keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes, focus management, accessibility mode, and text-to-speech integration.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to the specialized knowledge required for accessibility implementation and the need for thorough testing with screen readers. Critical for the application's purpose."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Cross-Platform Compatibility",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide cross-platform compatibility work into subtasks covering platform-specific issues, conditional code, styling consistency, layout adjustments, and dependency verification.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to the need to test and adapt the application for multiple operating systems. Requires handling platform-specific behaviors and ensuring consistent user experience."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 13,
			"taskTitle": "Optimize Performance",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down performance optimization into subtasks covering profiling, data optimization, UI optimization, asyncio optimization, and benchmark testing.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to the need for specialized knowledge in performance profiling and optimization techniques. Requires careful balance between performance and functionality."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 14,
			"taskTitle": "Update Testing Suite",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the testing suite update into subtasks covering unit tests, integration tests, UI tests, accessibility tests, and CI/CD setup.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to the need to create new testing approaches for Toga components. UI testing in particular may require custom solutions as Toga is relatively new compared to wxPython."

		{
			"taskId": 15,
			"taskTitle": "Update Documentation",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down documentation updates into subtasks covering user documentation, developer documentation, API documentation, and troubleshooting guides.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity as it requires comprehensive knowledge of the entire application, but the task itself is straightforward documentation work. Depends on the completion of most other tasks."
