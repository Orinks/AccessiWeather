# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Error Handling and Logging
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Migrate and enhance the error handling and logging system for the Toga-based application.
# Details:
1. Implement a centralized error handling system using Python's logging module
2. Create custom exception classes for application-specific errors
3. Implement error dialogs using Toga's Dialog class for critical errors
4. Add non-intrusive error notifications for non-critical issues
5. Implement a log viewer within the application for easy troubleshooting
6. Ensure all errors are properly caught and logged throughout the application

# Test Strategy:
1. Simulate various error conditions and verify proper handling
2. Check that error messages are clear and actionable
3. Verify that the log viewer displays all relevant information
4. Ensure error handling doesn't break application flow or accessibility
