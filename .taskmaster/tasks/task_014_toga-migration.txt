# Task ID: 14
# Title: Update Testing Suite
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10
# Priority: high
# Description: Migrate and enhance the existing test suite to work with the Toga-based application.
# Details:
1. Update unit tests to work with Toga components instead of wxPython
2. Implement integration tests using Toga's testing utilities
3. Create UI tests using a tool like pytest-gui or a custom Toga UI testing framework
4. Implement accessibility-specific tests
5. Set up CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or similar for automated testing
6. Implement performance tests to ensure optimizations are maintained

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that all tests pass consistently
2. Ensure good test coverage across all components and features
3. Conduct manual testing to complement automated tests
4. Regularly run full test suite during development to catch regressions

# Subtasks:
## 1. Update and Expand Unit Tests for Toga Core Components [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop and refine unit tests targeting Toga core components to ensure platform-independent logic is thoroughly validated. Focus on verifying core functionality, such as property assignments and method outputs, using standard Python testing frameworks.
### Details:
Review existing unit tests for Toga core modules. Identify gaps and add new tests for recently added or modified components. Ensure tests are backend-agnostic and validate core logic, such as widget properties and behaviors.

## 2. Design and Implement Integration Tests for Toga Backends [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Create integration tests to verify that Toga core components interact correctly with various platform backends. Ensure that backend implementations conform to defined requirements and interface contracts.
### Details:
Develop tests that instantiate Toga widgets and simulate interactions across supported backends. Use inspection and requirement definition strategies to ensure consistent implementation and naming across platforms.

## 3. Develop Custom UI Testing Solutions for Toga Applications [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.2
### Description: Establish a UI testing framework tailored to Toga's unique architecture, enabling automated testing of user interface elements and interactions. Address the lack of mature third-party tools for Toga by exploring or building custom solutions.
### Details:
Research available UI testing tools for Toga or similar frameworks. If necessary, implement custom scripts or harnesses to simulate user actions and verify UI state changes. Ensure tests are maintainable and can run across different platforms.

## 4. Implement Accessibility Testing for Toga Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.3
### Description: Integrate accessibility checks into the testing suite to ensure Toga applications meet accessibility standards. Develop or adapt tools to validate accessibility features within Toga's UI components.
### Details:
Identify accessibility requirements relevant to Toga applications. Develop automated tests or scripts to check for compliance, such as keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and proper labeling of UI elements.

## 5. Configure CI/CD Pipeline for Automated Test Execution [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.4
### Description: Set up and optimize a CI/CD pipeline to automatically run the full suite of unit, integration, UI, and accessibility tests on code changes. Ensure reliable reporting and fast feedback for developers.
### Details:
Select and configure CI/CD tools (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) to execute all test types on supported platforms. Integrate test reporting and notifications. Address any platform-specific challenges for running Toga UI and integration tests in CI environments.
