# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Main Window and Layout
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the main application window and implement the basic layout structure using Toga's MainWindow and Box layout system.
# Details:
1. Create a MainWindow class that inherits from toga.MainWindow
2. Implement a basic Box layout for the main content area
3. Add placeholders for major UI components (weather display, forecast, alerts)
4. Implement a basic menu structure using Toga's Command and Group classes
5. Ensure the window is resizable and has appropriate minimum dimensions

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that the main window opens with the correct title and size
2. Check that the basic layout structure is visible
3. Ensure the menu is present and clickable
4. Test window resizing behavior

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Main Window Creation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the main application window using Toga's MainWindow class, ensuring it is properly instantiated and displayed as the application's primary interface.
### Details:
Use toga.MainWindow to create the main window, set its title, and call the show() method to display it. This forms the foundation for all subsequent UI elements.[1][3][5]

## 2. Establish Layout System [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Implement the layout system for the main window using Toga's Box containers and style system to organize child components.
### Details:
Create a main Box container (e.g., toga.Box) and apply layout styles (such as COLUMN or ROW) to define how child widgets will be arranged within the window.[1][5]

## 3. Add Component Placeholders [done]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Insert placeholder widgets (such as empty boxes or labels) into the layout to reserve space for future UI components.
### Details:
Add placeholder widgets to the main Box to represent where future components (buttons, text fields, etc.) will be placed. This helps visualize and test the layout structure before full implementation.[1][5]

## 4. Define Menu Structure [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Implement the menu system for the main window, ensuring it integrates with Toga's application and window structure.
### Details:
Set up the menu for the main window, using Toga's built-in menu support. Define menu items and connect them to appropriate handlers as needed.[3][5]
