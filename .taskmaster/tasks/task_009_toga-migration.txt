# Task ID: 9
# Title: Migrate Background Operations
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Port all background operations and timers from wxPython to asyncio tasks in Toga.
# Details:
1. Identify all background operations in the wxPython version (e.g., periodic weather updates, alert checking)
2. Reimplement each operation as an asyncio coroutine
3. Use asyncio.create_task() to run background operations
4. Implement a task management system to handle starting, stopping, and monitoring background tasks
5. Ensure proper error handling and logging for background tasks
6. Update the UI using Toga's main thread to avoid race conditions

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that all background operations function correctly
2. Test error handling and recovery for network issues or API problems
3. Check that UI updates from background tasks are smooth and don't cause freezing
4. Ensure background tasks don't interfere with user interactions

# Subtasks:
## 1. Identify Background Operations [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Catalog all current background operations in the application, including their triggers, dependencies, and interactions with the UI.
### Details:
Review the existing codebase to list all operations currently handled in the background, noting which are event-driven and how they interact with wxPython's event system.

## 2. Design Asyncio Integration [done]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Plan how to migrate identified operations to use asyncio, considering event loop management and compatibility with the application's architecture.
### Details:
Determine which operations are suitable for asyncio coroutines, how to manage the event loop, and how to integrate with any existing synchronous code.

## 3. Implement Asyncio-Based Operations [done]
### Dependencies: 9.2
### Description: Rewrite background operations using async/await syntax and asyncio tasks, ensuring non-blocking execution and proper scheduling.
### Details:
Convert blocking or event-based logic to asynchronous coroutines, using asyncio best practices such as avoiding long-running synchronous loops and leveraging tasks for concurrent execution[1][3].

## 4. Manage Task Lifecycle and Concurrency [done]
### Dependencies: 9.3
### Description: Establish robust task management, including creation, cancellation, and tracking of asyncio tasks to prevent resource leaks and ensure correct operation sequencing.
### Details:
Implement mechanisms to monitor and control the lifecycle of background tasks, handle task cancellation, and coordinate concurrent operations safely[1].

## 5. Implement Error Handling and UI Updates [done]
### Dependencies: 9.4
### Description: Add comprehensive error handling for async tasks and ensure thread-safe updates to the wxPython UI from asyncio coroutines.
### Details:
Catch and log exceptions in async tasks, propagate errors to the UI as needed, and use thread-safe methods (such as wx.CallAfter) to update UI elements from async code[3][5].

## 6. Optimize Performance and Event Loop Responsiveness [done]
### Dependencies: 9.5
### Description: Profile and optimize the new asyncio-based background operations to minimize event loop blocking and maximize responsiveness.
### Details:
Identify and refactor any remaining blocking code, use diagnostic tools to monitor event loop health, and optimize coroutine scheduling to ensure smooth UI and background operation performance[1][4].
