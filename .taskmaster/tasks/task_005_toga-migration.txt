# Task ID: 5
# Title: Migrate Alert System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Migrate and implement the core notifications system for the weather app using the desktop-notifier library to ensure robust, cross-platform notification delivery outside the main application window. Focus on reliable, timely, and accessible notifications leveraging native OS capabilities, with error handling and test support.
# Details:
1. Integrate desktop-notifier for cross-platform desktop notifications (Linux, macOS, and Windows as supported)
2. Ensure notifications are delivered reliably with appropriate error handling
3. Use asyncio for background notification checking and delivery
4. Provide test coverage for notification delivery and error scenarios
5. Accessibility is handled by native notification systems and does not require additional implementation

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify notifications appear correctly on all supported platforms using desktop-notifier
2. Test notification delivery under various error and edge cases
3. Ensure notifications are triggered from background tasks using asyncio
4. Confirm test coverage for notification delivery and error handling
5. Accessibility is covered by native OS notification systems
