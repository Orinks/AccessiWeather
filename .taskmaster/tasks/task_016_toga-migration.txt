# Task ID: 16
# Title: Implement Debug Mode
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 10, 5, 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add a debug mode to the Toga app that can be enabled via a checkbox in the settings dialog, displaying additional debug/testing buttons throughout the UI for development purposes.
# Details:
1. Add a debug mode checkbox to the existing settings dialog (Task 7)
2. Implement a configuration option to store the debug mode state
3. Create a DebugManager class to handle the debug state and provide access throughout the app
4. Design and implement debug buttons with the following functionality:
   - Test notification button to trigger sample notifications without real data
   - Simulate weather alert button to test the alert system
   - Force data refresh button to test weather data updates
   - Log viewer button to quickly access application logs
5. Add these debug buttons strategically throughout the UI:
   - In the main weather display area
   - In the forecast display section
   - In the alert system interface
6. Ensure debug buttons are only visible when debug mode is enabled
7. Style debug buttons distinctly (e.g., with a different color or icon) to clearly indicate they are for development use
8. Implement persistence of the debug mode setting using the app's configuration system
9. Add appropriate documentation in code comments explaining each debug feature
10. Ensure debug features don't interfere with normal application operation when enabled

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that the debug mode checkbox appears correctly in the settings dialog
2. Test enabling and disabling debug mode and confirm debug buttons appear/disappear accordingly
3. Verify that the debug mode state persists across application restarts
4. Test each debug button to ensure it performs its intended function:
   - Confirm test notifications appear correctly
   - Verify simulated weather alerts trigger the alert system
   - Check that force data refresh updates the display
   - Ensure the log viewer displays application logs correctly
5. Verify that debug buttons are styled distinctly from regular UI elements
6. Test the application with debug mode enabled to ensure it doesn't impact normal functionality
7. Verify that debug mode works correctly across all supported platforms
8. Check that debug buttons are accessible via keyboard navigation and screen readers

# Subtasks:
## 1. Add Debug Mode Checkbox to Settings Dialog [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate a checkbox into the existing settings dialog to allow users to enable or disable debug mode.
### Details:
Modify the settings dialog UI to include a new checkbox labeled 'Enable Debug Mode'. Ensure the checkbox state can be read and updated by the application.

## 2. Implement Debug Mode State Persistence [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Create a configuration option to store and retrieve the debug mode state across app sessions.
### Details:
Update the app's configuration system to persist the debug mode setting. Ensure the setting is loaded at startup and saved when changed.

## 3. Develop DebugManager Class [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.2
### Description: Design and implement a DebugManager class to manage the debug state and provide access throughout the app.
### Details:
The DebugManager should expose methods to check if debug mode is enabled and notify relevant UI components of state changes.

## 4. Implement and Integrate Debug Buttons [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.3
### Description: Design and add debug/testing buttons (test notification, simulate weather alert, force data refresh, log viewer) to key UI areas, ensuring they are only visible in debug mode.
### Details:
Add the specified debug buttons to the main weather display, forecast section, and alert interface. Style them distinctly and ensure their visibility is controlled by the DebugManager.

## 5. Document and Safeguard Debug Features [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.4
### Description: Add comprehensive code comments explaining each debug feature and ensure debug features do not interfere with normal app operation.
### Details:
Review all debug-related code for clear documentation and implement safeguards to prevent debug features from affecting production behavior.
