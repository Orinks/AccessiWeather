# Task ID: 13
# Title: Optimize Performance
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 5, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Analyze and optimize the performance of the Toga-based application to match or exceed the wxPython version.
# Details:
1. Profile the application to identify performance bottlenecks
2. Optimize data loading and caching mechanisms
3. Implement lazy loading for non-critical UI elements
4. Optimize asyncio usage for efficient background operations
5. Minimize redraws and layout recalculations
6. Implement efficient data structures for storing and retrieving weather data

# Test Strategy:
1. Conduct performance benchmarks comparing Toga version to wxPython version
2. Test application responsiveness under various conditions (low memory, high CPU usage)
3. Verify smooth scrolling and interaction in the UI
4. Ensure optimizations don't negatively impact accessibility or functionality

# Subtasks:
## 1. Profile Application Performance [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Use profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks in the application, focusing on CPU, memory, and I/O usage.
### Details:
Leverage tools such as New Relic, Dynatrace, or built-in profilers to gather data on where the application spends the most resources. Document key hotspots and areas for improvement.[5][2]

## 2. Optimize Data Handling and Storage [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Improve data-related performance by optimizing database queries, schema design, and caching strategies.
### Details:
Analyze and refactor inefficient queries, implement proper indexing, and introduce caching for frequently accessed data. Ensure the database schema supports efficient data retrieval and storage.[1][5][3]

## 3. Enhance UI Responsiveness [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Optimize the user interface to ensure fast load times and smooth interactions.
### Details:
Implement lazy loading, minimize render-blocking resources, and reduce unnecessary UI updates. Focus on delivering a seamless user experience by addressing front-end bottlenecks.[3]

## 4. Optimize Asynchronous and Concurrent Operations [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Refactor code to leverage asynchronous programming and concurrency for improved responsiveness and throughput.
### Details:
Identify I/O-bound and CPU-bound tasks that can benefit from async/await patterns or multithreading. Ensure proper resource management and avoid common pitfalls in async code.[1][3]

## 5. Conduct Benchmark Testing and Validate Improvements [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.2, 13.3, 13.4
### Description: Design and execute benchmark tests to measure the impact of optimizations and ensure performance goals are met.
### Details:
Use benchmarking tools to compare pre- and post-optimization metrics. Analyze results to confirm that changes have led to measurable improvements without introducing regressions.[2][5]
