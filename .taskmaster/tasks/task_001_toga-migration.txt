# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Toga Project Structure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project structure for the Toga-based AccessiWeather application.
# Details:
1. Install the latest version of BeeWare Toga (currently 0.3.1) using 'pip install toga==0.3.1'
2. Create a new Toga project structure using 'briefcase new'
3. Set up a virtual environment for the project
4. Initialize git repository and create .gitignore file
5. Copy over relevant non-GUI code from the wxPython version
6. Update README.md with project details and setup instructions

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that the project structure is created correctly
2. Ensure all necessary files are present (pyproject.toml, app.py, etc.)
3. Confirm that the application runs without errors using 'briefcase dev'

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set Up Development Environment for Toga [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install Python 3 if not already present, create a new project directory, set up a virtual environment, and install Toga along with any required system dependencies.
### Details:
1. Install Python 3 using the official installer or your OS package manager.
2. Create a new directory for your Toga project and navigate into it.
3. Set up a virtual environment using `python3 -m venv venv` and activate it.
4. Install any necessary system packages (e.g., cairo, gtk3, gobject-introspection) as required by your platform.
5. Install Toga in the virtual environment using `python -m pip install toga`.[1][3]

## 2. Initialize Toga Project Structure [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Create the initial Toga application files and structure, ensuring the project is ready for code migration.
### Details:
1. Create the main application Python file (e.g., `app.py`).
2. Set up the basic Toga app structure, including the main class inheriting from `toga.App` and the `main()` entry point.
3. Verify that a minimal Toga app runs successfully in your environment.[1][3]

## 3. Migrate Code from wxPython to Toga [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Port the existing wxPython application logic and UI components to the Toga framework, adapting code as necessary.
### Details:
1. Analyze the wxPython codebase to identify UI elements and logic to migrate.
2. Replace wxPython widgets and event handling with their Toga equivalents.
3. Refactor application logic to fit Toga's event-driven model and widget hierarchy.
4. Test the migrated application to ensure feature parity and resolve any compatibility issues.
