# Merge strategy to favor Toga branch for wx/legacy GUI code and conflicting app modules
# These rules help when merging origin/dev into feature/toga-migration

# Use 'ours' merge driver for these paths (keep current branch version during merges)
# Note: Requires core driver 'merge=ours' which is built-in to Git.

# Legacy/wx-era app and GUI modules removed/replaced by Toga
src/accessiweather/app.py merge=ours
src/accessiweather/dialogs/** merge=ours
src/accessiweather/display/** merge=ours
src/accessiweather/gui/** merge=ours

# Models and services that diverge between branches
src/accessiweather/models.py merge=ours
src/accessiweather/services/** merge=ours

# Notifications diverged (sound, toast, etc.)
src/accessiweather/notifications/** merge=ours

# Any remaining legacy top-level modules we replaced in Toga
src/accessiweather/formatters.py merge=ours
src/accessiweather/location_manager.py merge=ours

# If dev deletes files we still keep, preserve ours
